# Funding ccBitTorrent

ccBitTorrent is a high-performance, open-source BitTorrent client built with Python. To maintain and improve the project, we rely on community support through GitHub Sponsors.

## Funding Model

**GitHub Sponsors is our only funding platform.** All donations are processed securely through GitHub's platform, ensuring transparency and ease of contribution.

## Funding Goals

We have established monthly funding goals to support different aspects of the project:

### Automated Checks and Multiplatform Builds
**Goal: $150/month (cumulative)**

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) requires significant compute resources:
- Running comprehensive test suites across multiple Python versions
- Multiplatform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Performance benchmarking
- Security scanning
- Code coverage analysis
- Documentation generation

These automated checks ensure code quality and compatibility but require substantial cloud compute resources.

### Quality Block Lists Access
**Goal: $300/month (cumulative)**

Access to high-quality IP block lists is essential for security:
- Protection against malicious peers
- Prevention of attacks and abuse
- Maintaining network integrity
- Supporting advanced security features

Quality block lists provide real-time threat intelligence and help protect users from potentially harmful connections.

### Third-Party Deep Security Audits
**Goal: $500/month (cumulative)**

Regular security audits by independent security firms ensure:
- Identification of vulnerabilities
- Best practice compliance
- Security architecture validation
- Penetration testing
- Code security reviews

These audits are critical for maintaining a secure BitTorrent client that users can trust.

### Additional Operational Costs
**Goal: $250/month (cumulative)**

This category covers:
- Infrastructure and hosting
- Domain and certificate management
- Developer tools and services
- Community management tools
- Emergency fund for unexpected costs

## Wall of Honor

**Founding supporters will be immortalized on our forthcoming Wall of Honor.** This permanent recognition will celebrate early supporters who help establish the financial foundation of the project. Contributors at various funding levels will be acknowledged for their support.
