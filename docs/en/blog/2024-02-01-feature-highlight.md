# Feature Highlight: BEP XET Protocol Extension

Today we're highlighting one of ccBitTorrent's most innovative features: the BEP XET Protocol Extension.

<!-- more -->

## What is BEP XET?

The Xet Protocol Extension transforms BitTorrent into a super-fast, updatable peer-to-peer file system optimized for collaboration. It's a key differentiator that sets ccBitTorrent apart from traditional BitTorrent clients.

## Key Capabilities

### Content-Defined Chunking

BEP XET uses Gearhash-based intelligent file segmentation (8KB-128KB chunks) for efficient updates. This means:

- Only changed chunks need redistribution
- Rapid collaborative file sharing
- Efficient storage utilization

### Cross-Torrent Deduplication

Chunk-level deduplication across multiple torrents means:

- Reduced storage requirements
- Faster downloads when chunks are already available
- Better network efficiency

### Peer-to-Peer CAS

Decentralized Content Addressable Storage using DHT and trackers provides:

- Distributed content addressing
- No single point of failure
- Scalable architecture

### Merkle Tree Verification

BLAKE3-256 hashing with SHA-256 fallback ensures:

- Strong integrity guarantees
- Fast verification
- Backward compatibility

## Use Cases

BEP XET is perfect for:

- **Collaborative Development**: Share code repositories efficiently
- **Content Distribution**: Distribute large files with minimal overhead
- **Version Control**: Track changes at the chunk level
- **Backup Systems**: Efficient incremental backups

## Learn More

Want to dive deeper? Check out our comprehensive [BEP XET documentation](../bep_xet.md) for technical details, implementation guides, and examples.

## Try It Out
