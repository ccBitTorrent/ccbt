# Requirements file for Read the Docs builds
# This file lists all dependencies needed to build the documentation
# Read the Docs will use this if .readthedocs.yaml specifies it
#
# Note: The project itself is installed separately via pip install -e .
# which will install all runtime dependencies needed for mkdocstrings

# Core MkDocs and theme
mkdocs>=1.6.1
mkdocs-material>=9.6.22

# MkDocs plugins
mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin>=1.4.7
mkdocstrings[python]>=0.26.1
mkdocs-codeinclude-plugin>=0.2.1
mkdocs-coverage>=1.1.0
mkdocs-blog-plugin>=0.25.0
mkdocs-static-i18n>=1.0.0

# Markdown extensions
pymdown-extensions>=10.15

# Additional dependencies that might be needed for documentation generation
# These are runtime dependencies that mkdocstrings may need to import modules
# The project installation will handle most of these, but we list critical ones
# to ensure they're available even if project install fails
